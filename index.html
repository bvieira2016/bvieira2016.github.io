	<p>First you start by taking the cardboard and cutting out two arc shaped pieces to form the front and back of the rainbow. You will then cut out two rectangular panels to form the top and bottom of the rainbow. Then you will tape the four pieces together to create a three-dimensional rainbow</p>

	<p>Once you have created the three-dimensional rainbow you will put it to the side and then take the newspaper. You will cut the newspaper into strips of any size of your choosing. After cutting the newspaper into strips, you will take the flour and mix it with the water to create the paste. After that you will take the newspaper strips and dip them into the paste and layer them all over the cardboard rainbow.</p>
	<p>After applying the newspaper, you must let the piñata dry over night</p>

	<p>While the piñata is drying, you can then start with the tissue paper. You will have to cut the tissue paper and fringe cut one end. Once the piñata is dry, you will mix the liquid glue and water together and then paste the tissue paper onto the front and back of the piñata starting from the bottom. You can then pick any color that you want and do the same for the top and bottom of the piñata.</p>
